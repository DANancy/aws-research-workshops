    "### Secure Operations with EC2 and AWS Systems Manger\n",
    "\n",
    "![SSM](../../docs/assets/images/ec2_ssm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will be creating an EC2 instance using CloudFormation to show you how to automate your [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code). We will also be leveraging AWS Systems Manager to show you how to gain shell access to your EC2 instances without using a bastion host. To get started we willuse a pre-created CloudFormation template in yaml and use the [Python AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) to launch the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)\n",
    "AWS Systems Manager is an AWS service that you can use to view and control your infrastructure on AWS. Using the Systems Manager console, you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. Systems Manager helps you maintain security and compliance by scanning your managed instances and reporting on (or taking corrective action on) any policy violations it detects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A managed instance is a machine that has been configured for use with Systems Manager. Systems Manager also helps you configure and maintain your managed instances. Supported machine types include Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs), including VMs in other cloud environments. Supported operating system types include Windows Server, multiple distributions of Linux, and Raspbian.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)\n",
    "AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of that.\n",

AWS ParallelCluster facilitates quick start proof of concept deployments and production deployments. You can also build higher level workflows, such as a genomics portal that automates an entire DNA sequencing workflow, on top of AWS ParallelCluster.\n",
