# AWS Research Workshops

Welcome to the AWS research workshops repository. Here you will find a collection of hands-on workshops that will give researchers the ability to get started with AWS and move into more advanced topics geared towards more specific use cases for their research. All workshops will be done in Jupyter notebooks and make extensive use of boto3 the [AWS Python SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) to provide a familiar view into leveraging AWS.
